L0(p,w0) = fr(p,l(p),w0) * ls cl/(r^2) cos@l

where

r = |pl - p|   <- dist between point p and light pl




I = Ia ka    <- Ia is intensity of ambient light non-directional) ; ka is ambient reflection coefficient of object

Brightness depends only on direction of light, relative to normal of surface

Lambertian: I = Il kd (N.L)

Specular: Reflect light in specific direction
		  R = I - 2.0 * (I.N) * N      <- R is reflection ; I is incident

Due to micro facets in surfaces, (Phong) approximation is: I = Il ks (R.V)^n      <- R is reflection vector ; V is viewer direction ; n controls distribution, typically 20-200

Point lights have position and optional direction
	Without direction, intensity Il = Ii is constant
	With direction, intensity Il = function(angle between direction, angle of light to object vector)
	Greatest intensity when two vectors have same direction
	Il = Ii(L.D)^n

Complete equation: I = Ia ka + sum(Iln(kd(N.L) + ks(R.V)^n))

where Ia is ambient intensity ; ka is ambient reflection coefficient of object
	  Iln is intensity of light (l) number (n)
	  kd is the diffuse reflection
	  N is normal to surface that is hit
	  L is (a vector...)
	  ks is (a reflection coefficient...(specular?))
	  R is reflection vector
	  V is viewer direction
	  n controls distribution, typically 20-200
